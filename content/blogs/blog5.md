Outside of work and study, I enjoy practice Chinese calligraphy, cooking, and kayaking. I am an avid Chinese calligrapher with 12 years of experience. I founded the first calligraphy club in my high school and college, and have taught over 40 people Chinese calligraphy over time.

Cooking is a lot of fun too. I can cook many different dishes in Chinese cuisine, ranging from squirrel fish to mung bean cake to pork rib soup. I would like to call myself a pro haha.

Whenver it's nice weather outside, especially in spring and summer, I'd like to invite my friends and go kayaking. Charles River in Boston is my favorite so far.
